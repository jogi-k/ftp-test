# Micro-Controllers

* Just a plain test for ftp-ing stuff with github actions onto my webspace
* And another text for testing...
* Right now the Markdown-File and the HTML are different
* Next step : convert MD to HTML and push that...
* Test one
* Test two
* UNd jetzt? Ein ![Link|test.html] 
* Does this now work?
* It looks like : Yes
* See the final result at http://calliope-jogi.org/micro-controller 
* Not much yet, but at least the simple conversion and the sftp-ing from the pipeline here seems to work
